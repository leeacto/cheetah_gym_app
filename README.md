##Welcome to the Cheetah Gym App

##Summary
The purpose of this app is to allow Crossfit gym members and their coach to track the outcome of their workouts over time. Crossfit emphasizes measurable performance over time.

Notebooks get lost, and spreadsheets get long. With this app, you can measure you will always have access to your hard work.

##Installation
1) Run <tt>git clone https://github.com/leeacto/cheetah_gym_app.git cheetah_gym_app</tt> from your command line

2) <tt>cd cheetah_gym_app</tt> to open the directory

3) Run <tt>bundle install</tt> to install gems

4) <tt>rails server</tt> will run the local server

5) Navigate to localhost:3000 to view the app

##Goals
This app is currently a work in progress. It is at Minimum Viable Product level, but I find that the User Experience is lacking. I am currently working on combining some of the user inputs to help save time.

There are quite a few CrossFit WOD-tracking apps out there. I built this one because I love coding, and I love CrossFit (more specifically exercise). I have never been able to really combine two separate interests as deeply as I have with this app. To put it shortly, I built this because it was fun!

##Vision
This app is initially built for computer input. Our athletes may not have the time to sit down at a computer, though. I hope to add CSS media queries to modify the layout for tablets and phones. I envision an athlete finishing a workout and then quickly entering his/her result on a tablet before leaving the gym.
